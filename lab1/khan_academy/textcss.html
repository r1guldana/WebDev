<h1>Groupers</h1>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        <span class="first-sentence">
        Groupers are teleosts (ray-finned fishes),
            typically having a stout body and a large mouth. </span>
        They can be quite large, and lengths
        over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such l
        arge group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces of
        f it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing
        tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans.
        Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the giant grouper
        (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.</p>
</div>

<p>
        <span class="first-sentence">
        Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey
            in from a distance. </span> They also use their mouths to dig into sand to
    form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill
    muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they feel
    attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in.</p>

<div id="cloud-sidebar">
    <h5>Why are some clouds yellow?</h5>
    <p>Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season. The yellow
        color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen
        dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.
    </p>
</div>

<p>In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals
    suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as
    aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

<p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of
    two processes: cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will fall to the
    surface.</p>

<h1>The Periodic Table</h1>

<p>
    There are three broad classes of elements:
    <strong class="metal">metals</strong>,
    <strong class="non-metal">non-metals</strong>,
    and <strong class="semi-metal"> semi - metal </strong>.
</p>

<h2 class="metal">Metals</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Solid</li>
    <li>Good conductors of electricity</li>
    <li>Ductile</li>
    <li>Malleable</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="non-metal">Non-metals</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Brittle</li>
    <li>Poor conductors</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="semi-metal">Semi-metals (Metalloids)</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Partially conduct electricity</li>
</ul>

<h1>Descendants of Khan</h1>

<p><strong class="emperor">Genghis Khan</strong> (<span class="reign">1206-1227</span>) was a emperor who had many sons and daughters, and many famous emperors are descended from him. (But not Sal Khan!)</p>

<h1>Animal group names</h1>

<p>For many species of animals, there are names that we use to refer to a group of them - like a flock of birds. Here are a few you might not know.</p>

<h2>A skulk of foxes</h2>

<p>Also called a "leash."</p>
